                                                                               </p>

I like to dress up for little or big occasions, study fashion and current trends in order to create my own style.
                                                                                              </p>

In fact, it helps me daily; to concentrate, study, and sleep. I enjoy discovering new types of music and making some different playlists. I have playlists for the winter season where I put some jazz and some soul music in, a summer playlist where you can find pop and rap, and last but not least, I created an autumn playlist with kpop and krnb in.
